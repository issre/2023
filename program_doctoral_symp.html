                <span class="fst-italic">Short bio: Prof. Philip Koopman is an internationally recognized expert on
                    Autonomous Vehicle (AV) safety whose work in that area spans over 25 years. He is also actively involved
                    with AV policy and standards as well as more general embedded system design and software quality.
                    His pioneering research work includes software robustness testing and run time monitoring of autonomous systems
                    to identify how they break and how to fix them. He has extensive experience in software safety and software quality
                    across numerous transportation, industrial, and defense application domains including conventional automotive software
                    and hardware systems. He originated the UL 4600 standard for autonomous system safety issued in 2020. He is a faculty
                    member of the Carnegie Mellon University ECE department where he teaches software skills for mission-critical systems.
                    In 2018 he was awarded the highly selective IEEE-SSIT Carl Barus Award for outstanding service in the public interest for
                    his work in promoting automotive computer-based system safety. In 2022 he was named to the National Safety Council's
                    Mobility Safety Advisory Group. He is the author of the books: Better Embedded System Software (2010), How Safe is Safe
                    Enough: measuring and predicting autonomous vehicle safety (2022), and The UL 4600 Guidebook (2022).</span>

                <span class="fst-italic">Short bio: Massimiliano Masi is Head of Cybersecurity Engineering in Autostrade Per L'Italia SpA. He
                    received his M.Sc. in Computer Science, and his Ph.D. from the University of Florence in the field of Formal Methods for
                    Cybersecurity. He is working in Cybersecurity for Critical Infrastructures since 2007. Dr. Masi participated in large EU
                    research projects involving 30+ organizations (public & private). He is involved in various security expert groups and in
                    standardization activities related to cybersecurity</span>

                <span class="fst-italic">Short bio: Dr. Simone Nardi graduated in 2007 in Mathematics with honors from the University of Pisa.
                    He received a PhD in Applied Mathematics, collaborating with the "E.Piaggio" Research Center and the Department of 
                    Information Engineering at the same university. In aerospace industrial since 2008, he has extensive experience in
                    developing CAD and GIS applications. He designed distributed control algorithms for the management of swarm of
                    heterogeneous autonomous vehicles. He worked on systems of automatic detection of anomalies using artificial Intelligence
                    techniques. He managed research programs on drone swarm control. His current interests are mainly focused on robotics
                    with the application of distributed control algorithms and coordination of drone swarms through game theory and deep
                    learning techniques.  Long experience in writing technical proposals and bids for publicly financed projects, both
                    national and European. He also served as a member of the NATO Industrial Advisory Group (NIAG SG-205) on Sense and Avoid
                    feasibility and certification for UAS flight in non-segregated airspaces. He is the author and co-author of several
                    scientific articles in international journals and proceedings. </span>
