                payments. Discounted <b><i>early registration</i></b> rates will be offered until <i>September 15<sup>th</sup></i>.
            </p>

            <p>
                The <b><i>full conference</i></b> registration gives access to all events included in the 4 days program, including
                reception and social dinner. The <b><i>single day</i></b> registration gives access to all events included in the day.
                Social dinner is not included in the single day registration, the reception is included in the single day
                registration of <i>October 10<sup>th</sup></i>.
            </p>

            <p>

            </p>

            <p>
                Rate discounting is offered for IEEE or CCF members and for Students. Special discounted rates are
                available within the term of the early registration for the doctoral symposium and for volunteers.
            </p>

            <p>
                Each paper included in the proceedings must be covered by an <b><i>author registration</i></b>, which can have
                IEEE/CCF discount but not student discount. Author registrations must be completed within the
                term of early registration. Non-authors and co-authors of papers already covered are allowed a
                reduced rate. The same registration cannot cover multiple papers.
            </p>

            <p>
                Papers presented in the research track or in the industry track must be covered by a full conference
                registration. Papers presented in workshops, in the doctoral symposium, in the fast abstract track, or
                in the journal first track, can be covered by a single day registration.

            <p>
                <b><i>Provisionally expected rates</i></b> are reported in the following for IEEE/CCF members. According to IEEE
                policy, each rate is increased by 20% for non IEEE/CCF members. Actual values of all rates will be
                updated after final acceptance of workshops papers. Prices are here expressed in euros.
